1. SLR and LALR Parsing 
Didn't properly handled SLR and LALR, why?

2. Syntax Directed Translation p.26
In E -> TE', shouldn't the semantic rule flipped so that E'.inh  = T.node and E.node = E'.syn? E'.syn will not be evaluated until E's children nodes are constructed.

3. Syntax Directed Translation p.35
Isn't it using shift-reduce? why top = top - 1 or top - 2?

4. Syntax Directed Translation p.43
Isn't bottom-up parser supposed to put semantic actions after the body of a production rule? so this shouldn't pose any problem?
