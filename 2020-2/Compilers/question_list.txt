1. Lexical Analysis p.64:
  BFS implementation?

2. Lexical Analysis p.68:
  |e-closure(s)| == 1 in DFA?

3. Syntax Analysis p.31:
  A, S ordering instead of S, A ordering => more than 1 production rule w/ left-recursion removed exist?

4. Syntax Analysis p.34:
  L = {wcw | w in (a|b)*} meaning?

5. Meaning of S is the start symbol => $ in FOLLOW(S)?

6. TDP p.31:
  does FOLLOW and FIRST assume that left-recursive is eliminated and left factored?

7. TDP p.32:
  can FOLLOW(Îµ) be defined? if so, is it meaningful?
